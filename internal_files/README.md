# Internal Pipeline Files

This directory contains intermediate and supporting files generated by the `dichromat` pipeline.

## Directory Structure

### `bam/`
Final merged BAM files for each sample, deduplicated and indexed.
- `*.genome.bam`: Aligned to the whole genome.
- `*.transcript.bam`: Aligned to transcripts.
- `*.genes.bam`: Filtered for specific gene sets.

### `bam/per_run/`
BAM files for individual sequencing runs before sample merging and deduplication.

### `fastq/unmapped/`
Reads that failed to map to any reference. These are useful for troubleshooting low mapping rates or identifying contamination.

### `stats/`
Detailed statistics and metrics generated at various pipeline stages.
- `stats/count/`: Throughput counts (Raw, Clean, Mapped).
- `stats/dedup/`: Deduplication logs and unique read counts.
- `stats/multiqc/`: Aggregated tables for MultiQC reports.
- `*.motif.tsv`: Motif-level conversion statistics.

### `pileup/`
Gzipped TSV files containing site-level information (coverage, conversion counts, motifs) for each sample.

### `qc/`
Tool-specific quality control outputs.
- `qc/trimming/`: Trimming reports (JSON format).
- `qc/fastqc/`: Standard FastQC reports for raw and unmapped data.

### `ref/`
Processed reference files, including custom FASTA files and HISAT2 indices generated from the configurations.
